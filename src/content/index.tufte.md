# I'm Matt Lewis.

I grew up ✂ in Wausau, Wisconsin. After high school, I attended the University of Minnesota{umn} and graduated in Computer Engineering in December 2014.

I currently live ✂ in Denver, CO and work at [Gusto](https://gusto.com){gusto} as a full-stack software engineer. We build payroll, HR, and benefits software for small businesses. My work focuses on our core payroll product.

I formerly worked ✂ as a technical project manager at [Rachio](https://rachio.com){rachio} in Denver. My work focused on deploying BDD test automation for production apps, designing product experiences, facilitating user research, and managing tooling to support internal teams.

Before that, ✂ I was a product developer at [Punch Through](https://punchthrough.com){pt} in Minneapolis. My work there focused on our development board for makers, the LightBlue Bean. I led development on our iOS and Android apps. I built the Bean Cloud Compiler{bcc} to compile Arduino sketches for our mobile apps. I also managed and maintained our website and store.

I adore planes ✂ and aspire to get my private pilot's license. I enjoy motorcycling with friends around twisty back roads{moto}. When the weather is nice, I love camping, canoeing{bwca}, and mountain biking. Other interests of mine include science fiction, blinky lights, and open-source software{foss}.
