# I'm Matt Lewis.

I grew up ✂ in Wausau, Wisconsin. After high school, I attended the University of Minnesota{umn} and graduated in Computer Engineering in December 2014.

I currently live ✂ in Denver, CO and work at [T-Mobile](https://t-mobile.com) as a devops engineer. We build the [TVision](https://www.t-mobile.com/tv) over-the-top cable streaming product. My work is in Kubernetes, AWS infrastructure, and Node.js microservices.

In past lives, I've built full-stack Rails payroll software at [Gusto](https://gusto.com) and Bluetooth Low Energy-connected devices and apps at [Punch Through Design](https://punchthrough.com). Check out [my résumé (PDF)](resume.pdf) to learn more.

# I do stuff.

I adore planes ✂ and aspire to get my private pilot's license. I enjoy motorcycling with friends around twisty back roads{moto}. When the weather is nice, I love camping, canoeing, and mountain biking. Other interests of mine include science fiction, blinky lights, and open-source software{foss}. I occasionally [talk about software](/talks/fdsa).

My résumé ✂ is [available here (PDF)](resume.pdf). Please feel free to contact me via email at [matt@mplewis.com](mailto:matt@mplewis.com).
