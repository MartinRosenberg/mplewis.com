  <h1>I'm Matt Lewis.</h1>
  <section>
    <p><span class="newthought">I was born</span> on January 11, 1992 and grew up in Wausau, Wisconsin. After high school, I moved to Minneapolis and attended the University of Minnesota<span class="sidenote">Go Gophers!</span>. I earned my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering in December 2015.</p>
    <p><span class="newthought">I currently work</span> as a software engineer at <a href="https://punchthrough.com">Punch Through</a> in Minneapolis. My areas of focus are iOS, Android, and full-stack web development.</p>
    <p>My work at Punch Through focuses on our dev board for makers, the <a href="https://punchthrough.com/bean">LightBlue Bean</a>. I was one of the primary developers on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bean-loader-lightblue-bean/id936509473?mt=8">Bean Loader for iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.punchthrough.bean.loader">Bean Loader for Android</a>. I built the Bean Cloud Compiler<span class="sidenote">As a proprietary web service, the Cloud Compiler doesn't have a website. Sorry.</span>, the web service that compiles Arduino code for Bean mobile apps.<p>
    <p>In addition to my work on Bean, I manage, maintain, and improve our company's web properties. I'm fluent in Rails, Django, and Flask, as well as client- and server-side JavaScript.</p>
    <p><span class="newthought">I adore planes</span> and aspire to get my private pilot's license. I enjoy motorcycling with friends around twisty back roads. When the weather is nice, I love camping, canoeing<span class="sidenote"><a href="bwca_2015/">See my latest trip to the Boundary Waters.</a></span>, and mountain biking around the beautiful Minnesota countryside. Other interests of mine include science fiction, blinky lights, and open-source software<span class="sidenote"><a href="https://github.com/mplewis/mplewis.com">See this site's source.</a></span>.</p>
    <p><span class="newthought">Please feel free</span> to contact me via email at <a href="mailto:matt@mplewis.com">matt@mplewis.com</a>.</p>
